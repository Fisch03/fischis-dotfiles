# fischis-dotfiles
## Those are my dotfiles, focused on providing a minimal look while still retaining the efficiency of a more standart setup.

### They affect the following tools and programs:
- [i3-gaps](https://github.com/resloved/i3) (not the official repo!)
- [compton](https://github.com/chjj/compton)
- [polybar](https://polybar.github.io/)
- [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi)
- [dunst](https://dunst-project.org/)
- [terminator](https://gnometerminator.blogspot.com/)
- [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)
- [vim](https://www.vim.org/)

### Things you may also want to install (programs which are used by some of the additional features, these can be disabled easily):
- [feh](https://feh.finalrewind.org/) (for setting the background image)
- [deepin-screenshot](https://www.deepin.org/en/original/deepin-screenshot/) (or any other screenshot utility)
- [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com)
- [Discord](https://discordapp.com/)

## What it does behind the scenes
### (if not explicitly stated, all of those can be disabled/customized easily from the i3 config file)

Other than changing the look, the dotfiles also do a few things behind the scenes, namely:
- Autostart Discord in the tray at startup
- Autostart Spotify in the Scratchpad
- Allow you to use the function keys your keyboard (change volume and brightness)
- Make a screenshot (requires some kind of screenshot utility)
- Set your wallpaper (configure in the .fehbg file)

## How it looks:
